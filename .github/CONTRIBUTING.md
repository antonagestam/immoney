## Contributing Guidelines

All sorts of contributions are welcome, ranging from raising ideas, reporting bugs,
helping review open PRs, pointing out problematic design decisions etc, and of course by
contributing code and documentation changes via pull requests.

If your inquiry is less concrete, or you want to ask a question, please [feel free to
start a new discussion][discussion]. There ain't such thing as a stupid question, and if
your inquiry has already been answered elsewhere, I'll do my best to guide you in the
right direction.

I'll look at all PRs, but it's worth noting that the project has a high bar for merging
contributions, and all features are expected to be well tested and documented. If you're
not sure what this means, it's totally OK to open draft PRs and ask questions.

The [README][readme] has instructions for how to set up a development environment and
testing code locally.
